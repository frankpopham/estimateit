# estimateit

The goal of `estimateit` is to estimate marginal effects using inverse
probability weights generated by
[`weightit`](https://github.com/ngreifer/WeightIt). Effects are
generated using `svyglm` and `svycontrast` from the`survey package.`
They include the effect for the treated, the effect for the untreated or
control, their difference, their relative difference, and their odds
ratio. As the previous sentence implies `estimateit` only works with
binary exposures and binary outcomes at present.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `estimateit` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("frankpopham/estimateit")
```

## Examples

``` r
## A simple example
library(estimateit)
library(cobalt)
library(WeightIt)
library(tidyverse)
data("lalonde", package = "cobalt")
W1 <- weightit(treat ~ age + educ + married +
                 re74, data = lalonde,
               method = "ps", estimand = "ATE")
summary(W1)
bal.tab(W1)
E1 <- estimateit(W1, nodegree, lalonde)
E1

## get all estimands

WS <-map(list(ATE="ATE", ATT="ATT", ATC="ATC", AT0="ATO", ATM="ATM", ATOS="ATOS"),
    ~weightit(formula = treat ~ age + educ + married +
                 re74, data = lalonde,  method = "ps", estimand = .x))

ES <- map(WS, ~estimateit(.x, nodegree, lalonde))

all_estimands <- map(ES, ~.x$Table) %>%
  map_dfr(~.x)
all_estimands
```
